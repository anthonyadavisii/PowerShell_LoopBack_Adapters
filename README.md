Hold My Crimpers. This was just a joke script for fun. Check out my YT vid here https://youtu.be/wkvpXaMfxnY

Issue the following w an elevated PowerShell console or ISE
Install-Module -Name LoopbackAdapter
You may then run the script. Modify the while loop if you want more loopback adapters to be cooler than me or James.
Use at your own discretion. I am not responsible!
